# Development of a Deep Learning Framework for Classifying Potato Leaf Diseases
Project for ECS 271: Machine Learning and Discovery

In this project, we developed deep-learning frameworks that incorporated feature extraction and stacked classifiers to accurately classify potato leaf diseases. 

## The methodology followed is given below:
### 1) We collected the dataset from Kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rizwan123456789/potato-disease-leaf-datasetpld
### 2) We balanced the dataset using image augmentation techniques. Balanced Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goayins/balanced-data
### 3) We trained some traditional ML models and noted down the performances.
### 4) Next we trained some pre-trained deep learning models and noted their performances too.
### 5) Then we developed our frameworks taking the best 4 deep learning models as feature extractors and developing a stacked classifier with traditional ML models as base models and ensemble models as Meta-classifiers.

# To run the codes
### Upload all the codes in Kaggle and import the datasets given above.
### Use Kaggle GPU P100 for the deep-learning and stacked classifier codes.
### Run the codes in the numeric order of their names.
